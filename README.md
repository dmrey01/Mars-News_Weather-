# Mars-News_Weather-
Module 11 Challenge
Part 1
  Created a new repo I named my Mars_ news- weather 
  worked on scraping the data about mars. 
  opened the HTML  looked over the site 
  made sure all the componets were loaded into the Juypter note book. 
  as I was working on this data scraping I had issues with some of of the context and finding the correct row id's. 
  I called a TA for help.  The TA kept telling me I needed to do a loop. which confused me more . 
  	as her time was up. i recieved a new TA -very helpful. They said my code was good but, I need to change my Td to TR.  
  	Once I was back on track I was good. They also help me change a few things on my loope. 

  	Part 2 
  	went a lot smooter 
  	until the end I was stuck on the very last setion with the dates .  Once i research this a little more I think I figured it out.
